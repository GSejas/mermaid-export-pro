2. **Test Setup Errors** 🔴
   - **Impact:** 4 test files failing to run
   - **ETA:** 1 day
   - **Risk:** Incomplete test coverage

3. **Error Handler Coverage** 🟡
   - **Impact:** Limited error scenario testing
   - **ETA:** 1 week
   - **Risk:** Poor user experience with errors

### Medium Priority (Fix for Production)

1. **Coverage Below Target** 🟡
   - **Current:** 76% vs **Target:** 80%
   - **ETA:** 1 week
   - **Risk:** Untested code paths

2. **CLI Strategy Error Handling** 🟡
   - **Impact:** CLI installation failures not properly tested
   - **ETA:** 3 days
   - **Risk:** Extension unusable without CLI
