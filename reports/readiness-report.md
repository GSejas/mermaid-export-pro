## 🧪 Test Coverage Analysis


### Coverage Breakdown by Category

```text
Statements:   ███░ 16.52% (measured by Vitest V8)
Functions:    ████ 54.54%
Branches:     ████████ 74.94%
Lines:        ███░ 16.52%
```

### Test Execution Results (latest)


- **Unit Tests:** 132 (131 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped) — local Vitest run (coverage enabled)
- **Integration Tests:** Mocha-based integration suite exists and passes when run with the VS Code test helper (separate runner)
- **Test Frameworks:** Vitest (unit) and Mocha/@vscode-test (integration)

### Failed Tests Analysis (legacy)

The major failing tests reported previously were addressed during the recent test remediation: several setup and assertion issues were fixed (conversion from Chai to Vitest, mocking of vscode APIs, and small test corrections). Remaining test failures (if any) should be reported and traced separately; unit tests currently pass locally.

## 🚨 Critical Issues & Blockers

### High Priority (Fix Before Beta)

1. **Missing Integration Tests** 🔴
   - **Impact:** No E2E validation of VS Code commands
   - **ETA:** 2 weeks
   - **Risk:** Production issues with command execution

2. **Test Setup Errors** 🔴
   - **Impact:** 4 test files failing to run
   - **ETA:** 1 day
   - **Risk:** Incomplete test coverage

3. **Error Handler Coverage** 🟡
   - **Impact:** Limited error scenario testing
   - **ETA:** 1 week
   - **Risk:** Poor user experience with errors

### Medium Priority (Fix for Production)

1. **Coverage Below Target** 🟡
   - **Current:** 76% vs **Target:** 80%
   - **ETA:** 1 week
   - **Risk:** Untested code paths

2. **CLI Strategy Error Handling** 🟡
   - **Impact:** CLI installation failures not properly tested
   - **ETA:** 3 days
   - **Risk:** Extension unusable without CLI
