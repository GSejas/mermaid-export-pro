# üéâ Release Automation Setup Complete!

## What I've Set Up For You

### 1. **Automated Release Workflow** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- **Triggers**: When you push a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.7`)
- **Does**: 
  - Runs all tests
  - Builds VSIX package
  - Creates GitHub Release
  - Attaches VSIX to release
  - Extracts changelog automatically

### 2. **Clean Git Repository** ‚úÖ
- **Updated**: `.gitignore` to exclude `*.vsix` files
- **Verified**: No VSIX files are tracked by git (good!)
- **Why**: VSIX files are build artifacts, not source code

### 3. **Documentation** ‚úÖ
- **Quick Guide**: `RELEASE.md` (root directory)
- **Full Guide**: `docs/developers/RELEASE-PROCESS.md`
- **Includes**: Complete marketplace publishing instructions

## üöÄ How to Create Your First Automated Release

### Step-by-Step:

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're on master with latest changes
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# 2. Bump the version (this creates a tag automatically)
npm version patch   # For bug fixes: 1.0.6 ‚Üí 1.0.7

# 3. Update CHANGELOG.md
# Add an entry like:
## [1.0.7] - 2025-10-12
### Fixed
- Cleaned up debug logging
- Fixed VS Code mock resolution issues

# 4. Commit the changelog
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs: Update changelog for v1.0.7"

# 5. Push everything (this triggers the release!)
git push origin master
git push origin --tags

# 6. Wait 2-3 minutes and check:
# https://github.com/GSejas/mermaid-export-pro/releases
```

## üì¶ What Users Will See

After the release completes, users can:

1. **Visit GitHub Releases**: Download the `.vsix` file manually
2. **Install via CLI**: `code --install-extension mermaid-export-pro-1.0.7.vsix`
3. **Read Release Notes**: Automatically pulled from your CHANGELOG.md

## üè™ Publishing to VS Code Marketplace (Optional)

To make it available in VS Code's Extensions marketplace:

1. **Create Publisher Account**: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
2. **Generate Azure PAT Token**: https://dev.azure.com/
3. **Add Token to GitHub Secrets**: Name it `VSCE_PAT`
4. **Uncomment marketplace job** in `release.yml`

Then your extension will auto-publish to the marketplace on every release!

## üßπ Cleanup Old VSIX Files (Optional)

You have these old VSIX files in your directory:
```
mermaid-export-pro-1.0.0.vsix
mermaid-export-pro-1.0.1.vsix
mermaid-export-pro-1.0.2.vsix
mermaid-export-pro-1.0.3.vsix
mermaid-export-pro-1.0.4.vsix
mermaid-export-pro-1.0.6.vsix
```

You can safely delete them:
```bash
Remove-Item *.vsix
```

They're already archived in GitHub Releases (or will be with the new workflow).

## ‚úÖ Verification

Before creating your first automated release, commit these changes:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/release.yml
git add .gitignore
git add RELEASE.md
git add docs/developers/RELEASE-PROCESS.md
git commit -m "ci: Add automated release workflow

- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automatic releases
- Updated .gitignore to exclude VSIX files
- Added comprehensive release documentation
- Release workflow creates GitHub releases with VSIX attachments
- Optional marketplace publishing ready to enable"

git push origin master
```

Then test with:
```bash
npm version patch
git push origin master --tags
```
