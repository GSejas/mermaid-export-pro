## 🐛 Known Issues

### ISS026: E2E Test Runner Fails on Windows

**Severity:** High (blocks E2E coverage on Windows)

**Symptoms:**
```
Code.exe: bad option: --disable-extensions
Exit code: 9
```

**Root Cause:**
VS Code test runner (@vscode/test-electron v2.5.2) has command-line option compatibility issues with VS Code 1.105.0 on Windows.

**Impact:**
- E2E tests cannot run on Windows
- E2E coverage shows 0% on Windows
- Merge pipeline still works correctly
- Unit test coverage (46%) still accurately reported

**Workarounds:**

1. **CI/CD (Recommended):** Run E2E tests on Linux/macOS in GitHub Actions
   ```yaml
   - name: Run tests with coverage
     run: npm run test:coverage
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   ```

2. **Local Development:** Run unit tests only on Windows
   ```bash
   npm run coverage:unit
   ```

3. **Dual Environment:** Develop on Windows, test on Linux VM/container

**Status:** Open (tracked in ISS026)
**ETA:** 7 days
**Assignee:** DevTeam

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Technical Insights

1. **NYC + Vitest Integration Works Well**
   - Vitest V8 coverage → `coverage-final.json`
   - NYC E2E coverage → `.nyc_output-e2e/*.json`
   - Merge script combines both seamlessly

2. **Coverage Formats Are Compatible**
   - Both tools use Istanbul-compatible format
   - LCOV is universal (works with all CI/CD tools)
   - JSON format enables custom reporting

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Unit tests (Vitest): Fast, isolated, mocked
   - E2E tests (Mocha): Slow, integrated, real VS Code
   - Merge: Best of both worlds

4. **Platform Differences Matter**
   - Windows: Unit tests work, E2E blocked
   - Linux/macOS: Everything works
   - Solution: Use CI/CD for full coverage

### Process Improvements

1. **Always Clean First**
   ```bash
   npm run coverage:clean && npm run test:coverage
   ```

2. **Check Merge Output**
   - Look for "Copied X E2E coverage file(s)"
   - Verify merged % > unit %
   - Confirm report files exist

3. **Use HTML Reports for Analysis**
   - Line-by-line coverage visualization
   - Easy to identify gaps
   - Better than terminal output

4. **LCOV for Automation**
   - Standard format for CI/CD
   - Works with Codecov, Coveralls, etc.
   - Machine-readable metrics
