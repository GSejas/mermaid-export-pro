## ⚠️ Limitations & Common Issues

### Known Limitations

**Diagram Complexity:**
- **Performance degradation** with very large diagrams
- **Browser rendering limits** for complex layouts
- **Memory usage** can become significant with multiple large diagrams

**Customization Constraints:**
- **Limited styling options** compared to dedicated design tools
- **Diagram type restrictions** - not all customizations work across all types
- **Layout algorithm limitations** - sometimes automatic positioning isn't optimal

**Error Handling:**
- **Syntax errors** can produce unclear error messages
- **Rendering failures** may not always provide helpful debugging information
- **Version compatibility** issues between different Mermaid versions

### Common Developer Issues

**Syntax-Related:**
- Reserved word conflicts (e.g., using "end" as a node name)
- Special character handling in node labels
- Quote and escape sequence problems

**Performance Issues:**
- Large flowcharts causing browser slowdowns
- Memory leaks in some preview extensions
- Export timeouts for complex diagrams

**Integration Challenges:**
- Environment differences between development and production
- CLI tool installation and configuration
- Theme consistency across different platforms

### Security Considerations

**For Enterprise Use:**
- **Sanitization required** for user-generated diagram content
- **Script injection risks** if diagrams contain executable code
- **Air-gapped environment** deployment considerations
- **Compliance requirements** for regulated industries

### Best Practices for Mitigation

1. **Keep diagrams focused** - break large diagrams into smaller, linked ones
2. **Validate syntax** before committing to version control
3. **Test exports** in your target environment
4. **Use stable versions** in production environments
5. **Implement proper error handling** in automated workflows

    B -->|Yes| C[Process Task]
    B -->|No| D[Alternative Path]
    C --> E[End Success]
    D --> F[End Alternative]
```

**Pro Tip:** Use `TD` (Top-Down), `LR` (Left-Right), `RL`, or `BT` for layout direction.

### 2. Sequence Diagrams - For Process Flows

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant System
    participant Database

    User->>System: Login Request
    System->>Database: Validate Credentials
    Database-->>System: User Data
    System-->>User: Login Success
```

**Pro Tip:** Use `->>` for solid arrows, `-->>` for dotted responses.

### 3. Gantt Charts - Project Management Magic

```mermaid
gantt
    title Project Timeline

    }

    class Cat {
        +String color
        +meow()
    }

    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat
```

### 7. Entity Relationship Diagrams - Database Design

## 💡 Best Practices & Pro Tips

### 1. **Keep It Simple**
- Limit to 7-10 nodes per diagram
- Use clear, descriptive labels
- Choose appropriate diagram type for your data

### 2. **Consistent Naming**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Login] --> B[Validate Input]
    B --> C[Check Database]
    C --> D[Generate Token]
```

### 3. **Use Subgraphs for Organization**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Authentication
        A[Login] --> B[Validate]
    end

    subgraph Processing
        C[Process] --> D[Complete]
    end

    B --> C
```

### 4. **Leverage Comments**
```mermaid
%% This diagram shows user registration flow
%% Created: 2024-08-27
%% Author: TechDocs Pro

flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Enter Details]
    B --> C[Validate Email]
    C --> D[Create Account]
```

### 5. **Version Control Friendly**
- Store diagrams in separate `.mmd` files
- Use relative paths for linking
- Include diagram source in documentation

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Syntax Errors
**Problem:** `flowchart TD A --> B` (missing brackets)
**Solution:** `flowchart TD A[Start] --> B[End]`

### Pitfall 2: Reserved Words
**Problem:** `flowchart TD end[End]` (breaks rendering)
**Solution:** `flowchart TD "end"[End]` or `flowchart TD (end)[End]`

### Pitfall 3: Special Characters
**Problem:** `A[Task #1]` (hash symbol issues)
**Solution:** `A[Task &#35;1]` or `A["Task #1"]`

### Pitfall 4: Complex Layouts
**Problem:** Too many crossing connections
**Solution:** Break into multiple diagrams or use subgraphs

### Pitfall 5: Theme Conflicts
**Problem:** Custom styles override theme
**Solution:** Use theme-compatible color schemes
