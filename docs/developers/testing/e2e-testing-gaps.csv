High Priority COMPLETED,10 of 14,71%,,,,,,,"Most high-priority scenarios done"
Total Estimated Effort REMAINING,15 days,,,,,,,"Down from 38 days - ~3 weeks left",

Risk Assessment BEFORE vs AFTER,,,,,,,,,
High Risk - No E2E Tests,BEFORE: 18 (49%),AFTER: 8 (22%),,,,,,"Reduced by 56% - major improvement"
Medium Risk - Partial Tests,BEFORE: 11 (30%),AFTER: 15 (41%),,,,,,"More coverage overall"

E2E Testing Framework Recommendations,,,,,,,,,
Current Framework,@vscode/test-electron + Mocha,,,,,,,,"Integration suite exists (extension.test.ts)",
Recommendation,Expand Mocha suite,,,,,,,,"Add more scenarios to existing integration test infrastructure",
Tools Needed,VS Code Test API,"temp-dir for fixtures, sinon for advanced mocking",,,,,,"Minimal additional dependencies",
CI/CD Integration,GitHub Actions,"Run E2E tests on Windows/macOS/Linux in matrix",,,,,,"Ensure cross-platform validation",
